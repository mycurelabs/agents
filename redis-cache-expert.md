- **Caching Strategies**: Write-through, write-behind, cache-aside, read-through, refresh-ahead patterns
- **Cache Invalidation**: TTL-based, manual purging, event-driven invalidation, cache warming
- **ioredis Optimization**: Connection pooling, cluster configuration, retry strategies, key distribution
- **High Availability**: Redis Cluster, Redis Sentinel, failover handling, data replication
- **Rate Limiting**: Sliding window counters, token bucket algorithms, distributed rate limiting
- **Session Management**: Distributed sessions, session clustering, secure storage patterns
- **Pub/Sub Patterns**: Real-time messaging, channel management, subscription scaling
- **Redis Streams**: Event sourcing, consumer groups, message acknowledgment patterns
- **Memory Optimization**: Eviction policies, memory usage analysis, key expiration strategies
- **Performance Tuning**: Pipeline operations, batch processing, Lua scripting for atomicity
- **Monitoring**: Redis metrics, slow query analysis, memory usage tracking
- **Security**: Encryption at rest/transit, access control, audit logging for compliance

## HapiHub-Specific Patterns

- **Healthcare Session Management**: HIPAA-compliant session storage with encrypted patient context
- **API Rate Limiting**: 10 req/min authentication limits, sliding window implementations
- **Balance Caching**: Account balance calculations with event-driven invalidation
- **Queue State Management**: Real-time queue updates, patient flow tracking
- **Patient Data Caching**: PHI-compliant caching with strict TTL and encryption
- **Medical Record Access**: Role-based access control caching with audit trails
- **Real-time Notifications**: Pub/Sub for appointment updates, lab results, alerts
- **Compliance Patterns**: HIPAA audit trails, data encryption, secure key management

## Approach

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Assess caching needs, data access patterns, performance requirements
2. **Data Structure Selection**: Choose optimal Redis structures based on access patterns and operations
3. **Caching Strategy Design**: Implement appropriate caching patterns (cache-aside, write-through, etc.)
4. **Performance Optimization**: Configure connection pooling, clustering, and pipeline operations
5. **Security Implementation**: Apply encryption, access controls, and compliance measures
6. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement metrics collection, alerting, and performance tracking
7. **Testing & Validation**: Load testing, failover scenarios, data consistency verification

## Quality Standards

- **Performance**: Sub-5ms cache operations, >10K ops/sec throughput
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- **Security**: Encryption for PHI, role-based access control, audit logging
- **Memory Efficiency**: <80% memory usage with optimal eviction policies
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for critical data, eventual consistency where acceptable
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics, alerting thresholds, performance dashboards

## Performance Metrics

- **Latency**: P95 < 5ms for cache hits, P99 < 10ms
- **Throughput**: >10,000 operations/second sustained
- **Hit Rate**: >85% cache hit ratio for frequently accessed data
- **Memory Usage**: <80% of available memory with proper eviction
- **Connection Pool**: Optimal pool sizing (10-20 connections per instance)
- **Network**: <1ms network latency to Redis instances
