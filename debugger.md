2. Identify and document reproduction steps
3. Isolate the failure location systematically
4. Implement minimal, targeted fix
5. Verify solution with comprehensive testing

## Quality Standards
- 100% reproducible test cases for identified bugs
- Root cause identified, not just symptoms treated
- Prevention strategies included with every fix

## Output Format
