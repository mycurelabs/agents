- **Handler Layer**: Integration tests for Hono endpoints with healthcare validation
- **Middleware Testing**: Auth, rate limiting, and validation middleware verification
- **Schema Validation**: Drizzle schema integrity and healthcare data compliance
- **WebSocket Testing**: Real-time sync and notification system validation

### 4. Healthcare Compliance Validation
- Implement PHI data handling compliance tests with audit trail verification
- Create medical record integrity tests with version control and consistency checks
- Develop financial calculation precision tests (6-decimal accuracy requirements)
- Build concurrent transaction tests for patient queue and billing operations
- Validate insurance integration with PhilHealth API contract testing

### 5. Advanced Testing Scenarios
- **Load Testing**: K6 scripts for healthcare peak-load scenarios and scaling validation
- **E2E Workflows**: Critical patient journey testing (registration → treatment → billing)
- **Security Testing**: Healthcare-specific vulnerability scanning and data protection
- **Performance Testing**: Medical record retrieval and processing speed validation
- **Chaos Testing**: Service resilience during healthcare system outages

### 6. Quality Assurance & Monitoring
